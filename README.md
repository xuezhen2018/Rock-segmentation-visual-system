# Manual-Made Dataset
We have released the "Rock Segmentation Dataset" to the community. Hope that it will help someone in the same research area.<br>

Please use BaiduDisk to download the dataset. Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qa82AG5vle8BOEc-ylCeyA . The pin number is 0903.<br>
If you have problems in downloading the dataset, please contact us at any time to zfxue0903@zju.edu.cn.<br>
If you find our work helpful for you, please kindly cite our paper:<br>

# Synthesized Dataset
The Unity engine as well as the simulated dataset will be released soon.

# Code
The code will be released soon as well.<br>
